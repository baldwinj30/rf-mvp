    "As we move through this notebook, we will use a motivating example of classifying NBA MVP award winners from the set of NBA All-Stars from 1980 (start of the 3-point line) to 2019.  This provides us with an interesting, real-world problem because we have an unbalanced dataset (there are significantly more All-Stars than MVP winners) with potentially irrelevant features.  So, let's start by loading in the data!  I have pulled the All-Star seasons from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com), using a script that will be provided.  I pulled the MVP dataset manually, as there were far fewer results for that one."

For example, many basketball fans would agree that which team a player plays for is not relevant to winning the MVP award, so we can likely throw out the 'Tm' column.  Further, a quick visual inspection combined with our knowledge of basketball tells us that three point attempts by themselves are likely not a good indicator of an MVP season as different playstyles lead to a different number of three pointers attempted and we don't know how effective a player was at making their threes.  \n",

    "Decision trees are models that learn to make a series of splits in a dataset through decisions based on the data features.  There are various algorithms for learning how to make these splits for classification.  In a decision tree algorithm, the decision to split the data is based on the \"purity\" of the resulting leaf nodes.  There are several measures of impurity:  <img src=\"img/DTImpurityCurves.png\"> In class, we covered Hunt's algorithm where we made splits using whatever feature and value minimized entropy.  As you can see from the plot, we wanted to split the data using whatever feature and value would result in very few data points in one child node and many data points in the other child node (towards the ends of the curve).\n",
